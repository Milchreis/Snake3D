Inspired by [The-Coding-Train Snake-Redux Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTDDsOZwdQY), I decide to programm my version of Snake in 3D but with the same look. Just JavaScript and P5JS make it possible :-)

Move the mouse up and down for change the angle of view and the arrow keys for moving the snake.
